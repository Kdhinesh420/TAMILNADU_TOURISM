            <h3>Pamban Bridge, Rameshwaram</h3>
            <p>The Pamban Bridge is a historic railway bridge that connects the island of Rameshwaram with mainland India. Built in 1914, this engineering marvel 
                was one of the longest railway bridges in India at the time of its construction. The bridge stretches over 2 kilometers and crosses the Palk Strait, 
                a narrow water body between India and Sri Lanka. The bridge is known for its unique design and impressive engineering, featuring a remarkable 
                bascule section (movable part) that opens to allow ships to pass through. The bridge offers breathtaking views of the surrounding sea, islands, 
                and the distant horizon. Both the railway bridge and the nearby road bridge (constructed later) are important transportation links and have become 
                iconic landmarks of Rameshwaram. Train journeys across the bridge are particularly scenic, especially during sunrise and sunset. The bridge holds 
                historical significance in India's transportation and engineering history.</p>
