            <h3>Vivekananda Rock Memorial, Kanyakumari</h3>
            <p>The Vivekananda Rock Memorial is a famous monument located on a small rocky island off the coast of Kanyakumari, dedicated to the memory of Swami Vivekananda, 
                one of India's greatest spiritual leaders and reformers. The monument was built on the spot where Swami Vivekananda meditated and attained spiritual enlightenment. 
                The memorial features a striking architectural structure combining South Indian and modern designs. Accessible only by ferry, the island offers breathtaking panoramic 
                views of the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean converging at the southern tip of India. The serene atmosphere of the memorial combined with the 
                stunning seascapes makes it a spiritual and tourist destination. The site attracts visitors seeking spiritual inspiration as well as those interested in Indian history 
                and culture. The ferry ride itself provides wonderful maritime views and an immersive coastal experience.</p>
