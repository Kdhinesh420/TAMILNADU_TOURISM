            <h3>Tiger Caves, Mahabalipuram</h3>
            <p>Tiger Caves is an ancient rock-cut cave complex located near Mahabalipuram in Saluvankuppam, built during the Pallava period (7th-8th century CE). 
                The caves are named for the intricate carvings of fierce tiger heads adorning the structure, which are remarkable examples of Pallava sculpture and 
                artistry. The complex consists of several caves and chambers hewn into the rock, with elaborate decorative elements and structural details that 
                showcase the architectural sophistication of the time. The tiger carvings are particularly striking, displaying the sculptors' skill in capturing 
                detail and expression. The site is historically significant and provides valuable insights into the religious practices and artistic achievements 
                of the Pallava dynasty. The location offers scenic views of the surrounding landscape and the Bay of Bengal. Tiger Caves is a lesser-known gem that 
                attracts history enthusiasts and archaeology scholars interested in ancient Tamil Nadu.</p>
