            <h3>Pillar Rocks, Kodaikanal</h3>
            <p>Pillar Rocks is one of the most striking natural attractions in Kodaikanal, featuring three massive vertical granite rock formations standing at 
                approximately 400 feet (122 meters) above the ground. Located about 8 kilometers from Kodaikanal town, these majestic pillars rise dramatically 
                from the valley floor, creating a breathtaking and awe-inspiring sight. The viewing platform near the rocks offers spectacular vistas of the 
                surrounding valleys, forests, and plains. On clear days, the view extends far into the distance, providing a sense of standing on top of the 
                world. The rocks are particularly impressive during the monsoon season when clouds hover around the peaks. The area is ideal for photography and 
                has become a favorite spot for adventure enthusiasts and nature lovers. The winding road to reach Pillar Rocks adds to the scenic beauty of the 
                journey.</p>
