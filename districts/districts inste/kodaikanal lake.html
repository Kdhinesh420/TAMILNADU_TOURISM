            <h3>Kodaikanal Lake, Kodaikanal</h3>
            <p>Kodaikanal Lake is a stunning man-made star-shaped lake that sits at the heart of the beautiful hill station of Kodaikanal. Created in 1863, this 
                scenic lake is one of the most visited attractions in the region. The lake spans a perimeter of approximately 5 kilometers and is surrounded by 
                dense forests, rolling hills, and well-maintained gardens. Visitors can enjoy boating in kayaks and pedal boats, cycling along the scenic path, 
                or simply taking leisurely walks while enjoying the cool mountain breeze. The lake is particularly beautiful in the early mornings and during 
                sunset when the sky reflects in the crystal-clear waters. The surrounding area has shops, restaurants, and viewpoints where tourists can relax 
                and enjoy the natural beauty. The lake is an ideal place for families, couples, and nature lovers.</p>
