            <h3>Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam), Tiruchirappalli</h3>
            <p>Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam is one of the largest and most significant Hindu temple complexes in India, dedicated to Lord Ranganatha (a form 
                of Lord Vishnu). The temple is spread over 156 acres and features seven concentric rectangular walls (prakara), each with ornate gateways. The intricate 
                architecture showcases the finest examples of Dravidian temple design, with magnificent gopurams (towers), elaborate sculptures, and detailed carvings 
                throughout the complex. The temple is a major pilgrimage destination for Vaishnavites (followers of Lord Vishnu) and attracts devotees from across India 
                and abroad. The spiritual atmosphere, combined with the grandeur of the architecture, provides a deeply fulfilling experience for visitors. The temple 
                complex includes multiple shrines, sacred ponds, and mandapams (halls) within its expansive grounds. The intricate stonework and artistic details showcase 
                the craftsmanship of ancient Tamil artisans. Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple stands as a monument to Hindu spirituality and architectural achievement.</p>
