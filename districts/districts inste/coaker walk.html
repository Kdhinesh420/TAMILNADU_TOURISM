            <h3>Coaker's Walk, Kodaikanal</h3>
            <p>Coaker's Walk is a scenic and well-maintained paved pedestrian pathway in Kodaikanal, stretching for about one kilometer. Named after a collector named 
                Coaker who initiated its construction in the 19th century, this walk offers some of the most spectacular panoramic views in Kodaikanal. The path 
                is built along the slopes of a hill, providing breathtaking vistas of the valleys, shola forests, and distant plains below. The walkway is lined 
                with stones and has several viewing points where visitors can stop to admire the magnificent landscape. The cool mountain breeze, fresh air, and 
                verdant surroundings make it a perfect place for a relaxing stroll. The walk is accessible to people of all ages and fitness levels. Early mornings 
                and late afternoons are the best times to visit for clear views and pleasant weather. The walk is particularly enchanting during the misty season.</p>
