            <h3>Thirumalai Nayakkar Palace, Madurai</h3>
            <p>The Thirumalai Nayakkar Palace is a magnificent 17th-century palace built by King Thirumalai Nayak between 1636-1646. This architectural marvel showcases a blend of Dravidian and Indo-Saracenic styles, 
                featuring colossal pillars, ornate arches, and majestic domes. The palace served as the royal residence of the Nayak dynasty and is now one of the most important historical monuments in Madurai. 
                The grand pillared halls, intricate carvings, and courtyards reflect the opulence and grandeur of the Nayak period. The palace underwent renovation and today stands as a testament to the architectural 
                excellence of the Nayak rulers.</p>
