            <h3>Shore Temple, Mahabalipuram</h3>
            <p>The Shore Temple in Mahabalipuram is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the oldest stone temples in South India, built during the Pallava dynasty 
                in the 8th century. This remarkable architectural masterpiece overlooks the Bay of Bengal and is famous for its intricate stone carvings and structural 
                design. The temple features three shrines and is adorned with sculptures of elephants, lions, and various deities. The Shore Temple showcases the brilliant 
                architectural and artistic achievements of the Pallava period, with detailed reliefs and ornate carvings throughout. The temple's proximity to the sea 
                and the surrounding monuments make it a fascinating historical and spiritual destination. The site is protected by UNESCO and is a major draw for 
                archaeologists, historians, and tourists from around the world. The Shore Temple stands as a testament to ancient Tamil Nadu's cultural and architectural 
                excellence.</p>
