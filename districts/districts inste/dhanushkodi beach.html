            <h3>Dhanushkodi Beach, Rameshwaram</h3>
            <p>Dhanushkodi Beach is a mystical and enchanting location at the southern tip of Rameshwaram Island, where the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean meet. 
                Also known as the "Ghost Town", Dhanushkodi was once a thriving settlement but was largely abandoned after a devastating cyclone in 1964 destroyed 
                most of the town. Today, it stands as a hauntingly beautiful reminder of the past, with remnants of old buildings and structures scattered across 
                the beach. According to Hindu mythology, this is the spot from where Lord Rama built his bridge (Rama Setu) to Lanka. The beach offers pristine 
                stretches of white sand, clear waters, and a sense of solitude and tranquility. The unique feature of Dhanushkodi is the convergence of two large 
                water bodies, where the colors of the waters remain distinctly different before merging. The beach is ideal for those seeking a quiet, offbeat 
                destination away from crowded tourist spots. The scenic beauty and historical significance make it a must-visit location.</p>
